I’m Jimmy, a software engineer based in Sweden.

By day I work as a Platform/MLDevSecOps engineer and by night I’m working on [lemon.js](https://github.com/jimmyflatting/lemonjs), a fullstack MVC framework for Node.js with JSX templating.

I like to experiment with building my own providers for Terraform, and also CRD’s for Kubernetes.

My main tech stack is:
- Typescript
- Python
- Golang
- Kubernetes
- Terraform
